# Phase I: Requirements Gathering
Ping Me Usability Team
Created by Adrian Arredondo and Cole Hopkins

# Methods 
Questionnaire (N = 7)  - We only used this method because it was the easiest way to get responses, and other methods such as focus groups and interviews would have been hard to get people who would be willing to participate.

# Findings 
Questionnaire - Using google forms to create a survey, we collected input from Chico State students, giving 9 questions to understand what users would want to accomplish from our tracking app. From the questions, we received some interesting finds. Our responses told us that most people would want to use it in a traveling or city environment, and not for use in the wilderness which is what we first designed our app to be used for. The results also told us that they did not want to use this app for a business setting, and all responses preferred using the app with friends and family. The last response we received that was helpful was that the responses wanted to add others in the app via phone number, rather than connecting through a friend system.

# Conclusions 
We found that every person that we questioned wanted to use PingMe in urban environments as opposed to rural areas. We also found that it is more important to most people to track someone elseâ€™s location rather than have their own location tracked by someone else. Everyone that responded to the questionnaire said that they wanted to follow other people via phone number and only three people responded that they wanted additional ways to track people. Over half of the respondents said they wanted to be tracked as frequently as possible, but others preferred to be tracked less frequently as well, indicating that we should have a setting to change the frequency of how often the user's location is updated.

# Caveats 
Questionnaire - Because we used Questionnaire, we were able to collect a lot of data from other users, but with a few limitations that it brought. We were not able to ask people directly and understand their beliefs and experiences with using other apps in an in-depth way, leading us to not collect crucial information. Another limitation was the responses that we got not being representative of our entire user-base, since we believe that everyone who took it was a college student.
