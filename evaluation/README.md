## Insights
#### Background Information
We wanted to figure out what type of scenarios that our test subjects might have found our application useful and the solutions they came up with in the meantime.
This is so that we have a better understanding of what type of applications are currently available on the market and are actively being used.
This question was to find out what people liked about our competitors’ applications and what features and designs they found useful and what shortcomings the apps had that we could fix with our own application.

#### Task 1
For the first task, we wanted the user to walk through how they would go about navigating to a specific friend and requesting their location. This was important because we wanted a seamless and fast way for users to share locations with another, which is the fundamental reason for our application. We hoped to discover that users already had an understanding of how to navigate to this based on prior knowledge of using other social apps.

#### Task 2
For this task, we wanted to get an understanding of how a user would interact with our entire application, tying both our friends page to the settings page. We wanted users to interact with multiple friends, view each friend individually, and also change some of the settings such as ping frequency and auto ping button. We hoped to discover that the flow from one action to another was fluid, while at the same time the buttons did not leave the user confused about it’s functionality.

#### Wrap-up 
Question 1: We wanted to find out what **features and design choices that were useful** in our current implementation
Question 2: We wanted to figure out what **oversights that we made in our design** and where we can **make improvements** to our current implementations.
Question 3: This question was to see **what advantages we have over our competitors.**
Question 4: This question was to see **what advantages our competitors have** over our application and this current stage of development.
Question 5: What sort of features did our subjects want?
Question 6: Did they have any thoughts or comments that were not covered in the previous questions?

#### Approach to the study
We took a formative, think-aloud approach to our study, we wanted to gain insight into what decisions our participants were making and what led them to those conclusions. Having the research subjects think-aloud helped us with figure out flaws that we had previously overlooked, and also how first time users interacted with our current prototype

## Findings
#### Background Information
We discovered that when our participants were trying to find another person’s location, it was most likely that they would directly contact them. The participants also commonly used Snapchat maps and Apple maps citing convenience and an already established user base. A common complaint was a lack of control.

#### Task 1
Everyone was able to complete the task and on a scale of 1 to 5, 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, our average was 4.6 with no one scoring it below a 4. One person got **confused by the global ping button** and another was **confused by the wording on “receive ping”**

#### Task 2
Two participants failed to update the ping interval and one failed to share location with parents. On a scale from 1 to 5 with 1 being very difficult and 5 being very easy, our average score was 3.4 with the three participants giving it a score of 3 or 2. Common reasons for the score was that the **auto ping button on friends was unclear** and **ping frequency was hard to find**.

#### Wrap up 
From the feedback, we determined that all the participants liked the **design and simplicity** aspect of the app the most. Regarding what they disliked the most, we found that many thought the application was **ambiguous and confusing** in terms of the uses of some buttons, automatic ping in the settings being the most commonly disliked. The participants found our app offered more **customizability and secrurity** features that other similar application don't offer, but lacked **distinct marker icons** that makes friends more identifiable on the map, which is offered and considered useful by our users. Additional features that our users would like to see were very broad, with the ability to call someone or giving best directions to someones location being a few examples.

## Improving Based Off Recommendations
Based off of the results collected from our users and understanding the findings, we were able to determine what we can improve upon our current design to give a better experience to our future users. The improvements that can be made are the following...

- Remove the non-human readable longitude and latitude coordinates from basic view in friends page, but incorporate it within a individual friend page.
- Change wording from “Receive ping” to “Request ping” for requesting an updated ping for a friend located in the individual friends pages
- Change the auto-ping identifier in the friends page to something more visually understandable, such as an eye icon rather than a circle.
- Change the global ping icon to have a forward facing arrow as just a globe icon did not insunuate if the function was a global send or recieve.
- Change time for friends to show how long since their last ping, rather than a timestamp of that ping.
- Group the ping frequency and automatic ping option together, where turning auto ping off allows users not to be able to interact with the ping frequency and vice versa
