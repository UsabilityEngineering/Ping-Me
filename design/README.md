# Interaction Design

### For our wireframe, we made the following pages with user design and experience in focus, delivering on our goals given to us from our results of the requirment gathering phase, and the personas and scenarios we constructed

## Maps (Home)

Using User Interaction Design, we developed the main page to act as a hub for all other functionality of our application. From our scenarios, we established that our users wanted a easy and simple way in which to send thier location to all friends, which we provided in a large centeralized button as to put confuse our users about the whereabouts of this functon. We also determined that having a main page with the two major functuionalities (settings and friends) made them easy to locate and navagate to, leading the user to not have to search for these functions. Furthermore, we had gained insight from our studies that users wanted an easy way to know when and where a user was last seen. Given this, we implemented markers for each friend of the user, making it easy to see who is where, and when they were last in that area.

## Friends Page

For our friends page, we wanted to give simple friend info that displayed to the user when they were last pinged and where, and letting users recieve much more information about that friend if interacted with. One of the cornerns we came across was having a relatively confusing search bar, which after receiving feedback we made it clear that you were both able to add friends or filter by friends currently on your list. Most of our results from the survey indicated that adding friends via phone number was the easiest method, so users now have the option to add either by user, or phone number.

## Friend

</p>
The indiviudal friend page gives alot of control to the user, allowing them to perform many actions that our survey and scenarios deemed important. One of these features is to give users the ability to not only sent a ping notification to the friend so that they know where they are, but a recieve ping notification as well, which requests from the friend for them to send thier location back to the user. In many of the personas scenarios we ran through, this was vital for our application, especially for emergency purposes which this applications idea was built upon. We also added the ability to remove a friend, for security purposes that our users find very important

## Settings
