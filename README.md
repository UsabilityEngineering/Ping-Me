# Ping-Me

This app's envision is to allow people to connect with one another and share there geo-location from around the world. It's goal is to bring people together
by letting them meet up in real life without having to worry about the directions to get there. Your just one button click away from telling your friends where
you are, and what you are up too. Ping-Me also has the goal of being a helpful tool for people who want their close ones to know where they are in case of an accident,
especially in a life or death situation that is out of your control.
