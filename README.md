# Ping-Me

This applications envision is to allow people to connect with one another and share there geo-location from around the world. It's goal is to bring people together
by letting them meet up in real life without having to worry about the directions to get there. Your just one button click away from telling your friends where
you are, and what you are up too. Ping-Me also has the goal of being a helpful tool for people who want their close ones to know where they are in case of an accident,
especially in a life or death situation that is out of your control.

# Phase 1: Requirements Gathering

**Executive Summary**

* Built **user stories** to determine who are users are 
* Estimated **UX priorities** to make sure we address users needs
* Understanding the **problem space** to develop a meaningful approach to the issue at hand
* Developing **research questions** for a survey to get real **user data** to help guide our development and understand what is important to the users
* Building **personas** to give us a way to understand possible users and their needs
* It is more important to people to track the location of others rather than share their own location
* People would prefer to add others using a phone number rather than a friend system or usercode
* Most people chose that they would want to share the location of themselves and others in urban environments rather than rural areas

# Phase 2: Interaction Design

**Executive Summary**

* Used user research data, along with personas and scenarios, to develop **user-oriented wireframes** for the application.
* From these wireframes, we **built a prototype** draft that allows for a flow of the application to control and test functionality and efficiency for the user and their goals.
* Our user research indicated that people wanted to have **full control** over when and how often they share their location with others. Given this feedback, we gave users the ability to **share location with specific users**, **toggle location sharing** on and off, and let users decide how often they want their position updated.
* Users wanted a decent amount of information about friends' positions and the last time they updated their location. Given this, we created markers on a map, **showing location in real-time** with a timestamp displaying their last updated location.
* Users wanted a way to **request someone's position** from the application, allowing people to communicate through this function. Taking our user's feedback into consideration, we implemented this as a feature, so that people can be notified by others that they want to know where they are, or share with them their location.

# Phase 3: Usability Evaluation

**Executive Summary**

* From our **heuristic evaluation** and **cognitive walkthroughs**, we obtained important findings from our participants that will help us improve upon the design of our application
* We found that our application has favored for having a strong **visual and aesthetic design**, as well as simple to navigate due to it's strong reliance on **external consistency and standards**
* We discovered flaws in **visibility of system status** concerning important functionality and visual cues
